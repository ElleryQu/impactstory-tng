    <h2>Impactstory achievements</h2>
    <div class="intro">
        <p>Achievements are a way of looking beyond the numbers to find stories that matter:
            stories the buzz your research is generating, the level of engagement with your work,
            your openness, and some lighthearted fun from time to time.

        <div class="badge-group" ng-repeat="badgeGroup in badgeGroups | orderBy: 'sortLevel'">
            <div class="about {{ badgeGroup.name }}">
                <h4 class="badge-group {{ badgeGroup.name }}">
                    <i class="fa fa-{{ getBadgeIcon(badgeGroup.name) }}"></i>

                </h4>


                <p class="def buzz" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='buzz'">
                    <strong>Buzz</strong> is the volume of discussion (good and bad)
                    around your research. It's a good&mdash;if coarse&mdash;measure of online interest around
                    your work.
                </p>
                <p class="def influence" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='engagement'">
                    <strong>Engagement</strong> is about <em>how</em> your work is mentioned, accounting
                    for the different impacts of different sources: Wikipedia counts for more than Facebook, and a tweeter
                    with a million followers counts for more than one with a hundred.
                </p>
                <p class="def openness" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='openness'">
                    <strong>Openness</strong> looks at how easy it is for people to actually read and use
                    your research; publishing in Open Access venues is a big part of this, but so is
                    publishing open data and code, and publishing in ways that build lay and practioner
                    audiences.

                </p>
                <p class="def fun" ng-show="badgeGroup.name=='fun'">
                    <strong>Fun</strong> achievements are Not So Serious.
