        <em>Public works with DOIs</em>

    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Public works</em> means anyone can seem them. <em>With DOIs</em> means the
        works have a Document Object Identifier (DOI), a special unique ID assigned to most
        scholarly articles as well as many datasets, software, and more.
    </p>
    <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
    <p>
        There are three reasons a publication on your ORCID might not show up on your Impactstory:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h5>The work isn't Public on ORCID</h5>
            <p>
                <em>Solution:</em> make sure all your ORCID works are set to Public.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>The work has no DOI set on ORCID</h5>
            <p>
                <em>Solution:</em> Add DOIs to your works on ORCID. You can enter these manually on ORCID, but
                the easiest way is to re-add the works using ORCID's <em>Scopus</em> or <em>DataCite</em>
                importers; these will bring in the works again, but this time with DOIs.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>The work has no DOI at all</h5>
            Some scholarly works&mdash;especialy conference proceedings, book chapters, and articles
            from small publishers&mdash;were never assigned a DOI. Unfortunately you won't be able
            to import these works into Impactstory as-is; our system needs DOIs to work.
        </li>
    </ul>
