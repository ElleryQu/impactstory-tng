        Impactstory imports all your Public works on ORCID that have DOIs (A <a
            href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi.aspx">DOI</a> is a unique
        ID assigned to most scholarly articles, as well as many other products like datasets and figures).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes a publication might show up on your ORCID, but not on Impactstory. There are three reasons why:
    </p>
    <ul class="orcid-fails">
        <li>
            <h4>The work isn't Public on ORCID</h4>
            <p>
                <em>Solution:</em> make sure all your ORCID works are set to Public, like this:
                <img src="static/img/gif/orcid-set-public.gif" width="400">

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>The work has no DOI set on ORCID</h4>
            <p>
                <em>Solution:</em> Add DOIs to your works on ORCID. You can enter these manually, but
                the easiest way is to re-add the works using ORCID's <em>Scopus</em> or <em>DataCite</em>
                importers; these will bring in the works again, but this time with DOIs.
                <img src="static/img/gif/orcid-import-scopus.gif" width="400">
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>The work has no DOI at all</h4>
            <p>
                <!--
                Some very small publishers do not assign DOIs. Neither do YouTube, SlideShare, or
                other general-audience content hosts. You can't fix this for the original versions.

                -->
                <em>Solution:</em> archive your publications
                in a <em>repository</em> get a DOI for the new, persistently-archived version. Then you can import the new DOI into
                ORCID and Impactstory as normal. Here's how to
                <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/impact-challenge-dois/">
                    archive your articles, slides, datasets, and more.
                </a>

                <!--
                Not only will it be easier
                to track moving forward, it'll also be less vulnerable to
                <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0115253">link rot</a>
                in the future.
                -->

        </li>
    </ul>
