        Impactstory imports all your Public works on ORCID that have DOIs (A <a
            href="http://www.apastyle.org/learn/faqs/what-is-doi.aspx">DOI</a> is a unique
        ID assigned to most scholarly articles, as well as many other products like datasets and figures).
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes a publication might show up on your ORCID, but not on Impactstory. Here's how to fix it:
    </p>
    <div class="ways-to-fix-missing-publications">
        <h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Make your works Public on ORCID</h4>
        <p>
            Impactstory can't see your works unless their privacy is set to Public. Luckily, that's easy to do:
            <img src="static/img/gif/orcid-set-public.gif" width="400">
        </p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Make sure your works have DOIs on ORCID</h4>
        <p>
            Impactstory needs DOIs to work.
            But if you entered your ORCID works via BibTeX in the past, the DOIs for your works may have
            not been added correctly. You can fix that by re-adding the works using ORCID's <em>Scopus</em> or <em>DataCite</em>
            importers; these will import the works again, but this time with DOIs:
            <img src="static/img/gif/orcid-import-scopus.gif" width="400">
        </p>
        <h4><i class="fa fa-check"></i>Get DOIs for your remaining works</h4>
        <p>
            Some small publishers don't assign DOIs. Neither do YouTube, SlideShare, or
            other mainstream content hosts. You can't fix this for the original versions.

            But you can archive your publications
            in a <em>repository</em> to get a DOI for the new, persistently-archived version. Then you can import the new DOI into
            ORCID and Impactstory as normal. Here's an article detailing how:

                Archive your articles, slides, datasets, and more.
