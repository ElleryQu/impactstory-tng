  "abstract": "The possibility of directly converting non-neuronal cells into neurons insitu in the brain would open therapeutic avenues aimed at repairing the brain after injury or degenerative disease. We have developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based reporter system that allows selective GFP labeling of reprogrammed neurons. In this system, GFP is turned on only in reprogrammed neurons where it is stableand maintained for long time periods, allowing for histological and functional characterization of mature neurons. When combined with a modified rabies virus-based trans-synaptic tracing methodology, the system allows mapping of 3D circuitry integration into local and distal brain regions and shows that the newly reprogrammed neurons are integrated into host brain. Torper etal. have developed an AAV-based system for invivo neural conversion with neuron-specific reporters allowing for long-term histological and functional characterization. The in-vivo. -converted neurons are shown to be functional and integrate into host neural circuits, as assessed with rabies-virus-based tracing.",
